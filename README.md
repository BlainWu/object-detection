## 1.Introduction  

> *This project is for my graduation project which is under the guidance of Dr.Prashant and Dr.Fei Xie in [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/).*  

Object detection is one of the fundamental tasks in the computer vision. By studying existing object detection methods, 
I need to develop an object detection algorithm for detecting balls of known colours in an image. 
On this basis, track the ball in a sequence of images. And finally build a real-time object detection 
system on the Raspberry Pi.
